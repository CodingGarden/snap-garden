## Ideas
  
* Joshua Ferris
  * You could also add the option to "randomize their location" it slightly skews it - enough to be non specific
---
* Jesus Bibieca
  * allow the user to select how much you should randomize the location
---
* Joshua Ferris
  * Within x distance to view the image
---
* John Smith
  * Remove exif data for privacy reasons
---
* Omar ElKhatib
  * use an ready AI to detect if the photo posted it does not contain any nudes or violence
---
* "Trusted Users"
* Joshua Ferris
  * I mean when they login and you get their profile data - only accept users that have filled fields on their account provider
---
* Infi
  * Image shall be able to be captioned with markdown, with a high character limit (1024)
---
* Bojan DediÄ‡
  * Adding a karma to pics, so the image stays longer on the map if the karma is high, like on reddit.
---
* Aman Singh
  * lets just write a decay rate algorithm per post based on views, likes and comments
